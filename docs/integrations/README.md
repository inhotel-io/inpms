# Integration recipes

Short, practical how-tos for wiring inPMS to common automation and back-office tools. Each recipe points at real REST paths on your inPMS instance (`/api/v1/...`).

For the full integration catalog, see **[Integration catalog](../INTEGRATIONS.md)**.

**Shipped demos (one command):** [`integrations/demos/`](../../integrations/demos/) — `./integrations/demos/run.sh stripe` (or `all`). Turns the Integrations toggle on and wires mock/console paths without vendor keys.

For event delivery (signatures, payloads, retries, subscriptions), start with **[Webhooks & events](../webhooks.md)**.
