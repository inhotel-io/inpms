# Wave 3 partner surface (registry)

Wave 3 items are **new surface / partner processes**: start partner applications and certification where required; implement adapters when credentials and domain docs exist. They appear in the integration registry as `planned` (or `adapter` when a console handoff key is wired).

Status meanings: see [INTEGRATIONS.md — Catalog status](../INTEGRATIONS.md#catalog-status-registry). `shipped` = in-product path; `adapter` often means console until partner/authority clients; `recipe` = docs on existing APIs; `planned` = not started.

After `pnpm migrate` / push-schema, browse `GET /api/v1/admin/integrations` (and the property Integrations dashboard).

## How to enable a planned row

1. Complete vendor partner apply / sandbox signup outside inPMS.
2. Implement the matching provider interface (channel, payment, lock, fiscal, messaging, or a new module when required).
3. Flip registry seed `status` / `adapterKey` and ship a public recipe under `docs/integrations/`.

Do **not** invent government or vendor API contracts. Fiscal/guest-reg console keys: [wave3-fiscal-guest-reg.md](wave3-fiscal-guest-reg.md). Paid/gated packs: [compliance-market-entry.md](compliance-market-entry.md).
